I conducted research on automated detection of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) by leveraging both ultrasound images and demographic and clinical data such as age, BMI, menstrual history, and hormonal levels. A CNN-based deep learning model was developed to analyze ultrasound scans, while structured clinical data was integrated to improve predictive accuracy. To ensure interpretability, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques were applied, providing transparent reasoning behind the modelâ€™s decisions for clinical reliability. The study utilized the Kaggle PCOS dataset, combining image and non-image data for comprehensive analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted tools to support gynecologists in early detection and effective management of PCOS.
