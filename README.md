I conducted research on automated detection of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using ultrasound images and deep learning techniques. A CNN-based model was developed and trained to classify medical images, enabling early and accurate diagnosis. To enhance clinical trust, I integrated Explainable AI (XAI) methods that provide interpretability and transparency of the modelâ€™s decisions. The research was carried out using the Kaggle PCOS ultrasound dataset, and the proposed solution demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy. This work aims to support gynecologists with a reliable AI-assisted healthcare tool for early detection and better patient care.
